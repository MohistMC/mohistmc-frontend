## Use the WorldGuard plugin in Youer

WorldGuard itself works fine on the Youer server, but it is important to note that its dependent pre-plugged `WorldEdit` requires the use of a fixed version.

### Prerequisites

Since WorldGuard relies on the WorldEdit plugin, you need to install the fixed version of WorldEdit first:

### Compatibility Notes

If you encounter an error when using `WorldGuard`, it is usually not a problem with `WorldGuard` itself, but because of a compatibility issue with its pre-plugged `WorldEdit` with the Your server.

### Solution

Just make sure you have the `WorldEdit` plugin installed for the fix above and `WorldGuard` will work.
