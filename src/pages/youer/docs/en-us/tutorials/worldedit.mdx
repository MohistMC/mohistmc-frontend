## Use the WorldEdit plugin in Youer

### Compatibility issue description

The Your server added custom content to the `Material` enumeration via dynamic injection, and the original WorldEdit plugin used Bukkit native `Registry.MATERIAL` to get a list of server-supported items and blocks, which caused compatibility issues.

### Fix Scenarios

In the WorldEdit fix, we modified the way the Material Registry is obtained:

- **Original Method**: Use `Registry.MATERIAL`
- **Post-fix**: Use Youer's `Material.BY_NAME.values()`

This ensures that WorldEdit correctly recognizes all items and blocks in the Your server.
