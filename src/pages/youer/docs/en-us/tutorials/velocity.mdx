### How to use Velocity with Youer?

-> **paper-config/paper-global.yml**

```yaml
proxies:
  velocity:
    enabled: true
    online-mode: false
    secret: ''
```

-> **server.properties**

```properties
online-mode=false
```

- Now, create a new folder for your Velocity proxy and start it with the following java command:

```bat
java -jar <velocity jar name>.jar
```

- Then after the proxy is fully started, type "**end**" to shut down your proxy.

- Now, you need to change **velocity.toml** in the Velocity folder:

-> **velocity.toml**

```toml
player-info-forwarding-mode = "modern"
```


For more detailed tutorials, please read [Paper Documentation](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/) and [Velocity Documentation](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity)

- Now you can start your proxy and all Youer servers!
