# Install Mohist on Linux

<Steps>
    ### Download

    To create a Mohist server, you have to download the version you want from the [downloads
    page](https://mohistmc.com/downloadSoftware?project=mohist).

    You can also download via CLI:
    <Tabs items={['wget', 'curl']}>
        <Tabs.Tab>
            ```sh
            wget https://mohistmc.com/api/v2/projects/mohist/[minecraftVersion]/builds/latest/download
            ```
        </Tabs.Tab>
        <Tabs.Tab>
            ```sh
            curl -O https://mohistmc.com/api/v2/projects/mohist/[minecraftVersion]/builds/latest/download
            ```
        </Tabs.Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Make sure to replace `[minecraftVersion]` by the right version you want to download. See [available
    versions](https://mohistmc.com/downloadSoftware?project=mohist) for more information.

    ### Create a folder

    Create a folder with the name of your choice for your server. When it's done, move the downloaded file to this new
    folder.

    <Callout>
        If you already have a Spigot / Forge server and want to switch to Mohist, it's better to create a fresh new
        server and then add your map, mods and plugins.
    </Callout>

    ### Run the server

    It's almost done! To run your server, **do not double click the jar file!**.

    <Tabs items={['Using script', 'Using terminal']}>
        <Tabs.Tab>
            You have to create a file called
            `start.sh` where you dropped the Mohist jar file.

            Write this to the `start.sh` file:
            ```bash
            java -jar -Xmx4G downloaded-jar-file.jar
            ```

            Replace `downloaded-jar-file.jar` by the real name of the jar file you dropped to your server folder.

            When it's done, double click `start.sh`.
        </Tabs.Tab>
        <Tabs.Tab>
            Open a terminal and go to the folder where you dropped the Mohist jar file.

            Then, run this command:
            ```bash
            java -jar -Xmx4G downloaded-jar-file.jar
            ```
            Replace `downloaded-jar-file.jar` by the real name of the jar file you dropped to your server folder.
        </Tabs.Tab>
    </Tabs>
