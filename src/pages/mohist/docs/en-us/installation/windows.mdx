# Install Mohist on Windows

<Steps>
    ### Download

    To create a Mohist server, you have to download the version you want from the [downloads page](https://mohistmc.com/downloadSoftware?project=mohist)

    ### Create a folder

    Create a folder with the name of your choice for your server. When it's done, drag and drop your file into this folder.

    <Callout>
        If you already have a Spigot / Forge server and want to switch to Mohist, it's better to create a fresh new server and then add your map, mods and plugins.
    </Callout>

    ### Run the server

    It's almost done! To run your server, **do not double click the jar file!**. You have to create a file called `start.bat` where you dropped the Mohist jar file.

    Write this to the `start.bat` file:
    ```bash
    java -jar -Xmx4G downloaded-jar-file.jar
    ```

    Replace `downloaded-jar-file.jar` by the real name of the jar file you dropped to your server folder.

    <Callout type="warning">Make sure the server file name inside the `start.bat` ends with `.jar`</Callout>

    When it's done, double click `start.bat`.

</Steps>
