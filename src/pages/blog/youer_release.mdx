After a month of testing, the Youer-1.21.1 version is now officially released.

Youer is a hybrid server software combining **NeoForge + Paper API**.
* **Development Progress**:
    * Track progress at [Youer-1.21.1-Progress](https://github.com/MohistMC/Youer/issues/1).
    * Paper API integration is not yet complete. Currently, Youer-1.21.1 only supports **NeoForge + Spigot API**. Paper API support will be added in future updates.
* **Features**:
    * Most functionalities align with Mohist-1.20.1.
    - World Manager now supports **superflat world generation**.
    - More details will be documented later.
* **Compatibility**:
    * Priority is given to **mod compatibility fixes** (not all mods are guaranteed to work).
    * Plugin compatibility is lower priority; focus remains on mod support.
* **Feedback Channels**:
    * Submit GitHub issues.
    * Discord `#Donator` role priority channel.
* **Beta Testers**:
    * Testers may submit GitHub issues (prioritized) or join Discord `#Donator` channel.
    * Early access to **unreleased fixes** (test builds).
* **Release Cadence**:
    * **Stable builds**: Weekly.
    * **Test builds**: Daily (irregular updates).

### FAQ
**Why weekly stable releases with beta testing?**
* Development resources are limited (multiple server frameworks maintained).

**Why was my issue ignored?**
* High-priority issues are addressed first. Some problems may be technically unfeasible.

**Will Youer support more versions?**
* Only 1.21.1 is planned. Future versions (e.g., 1.22.1) depend on community demand.

**Why wasn't NeoForge+ Paper released?**
* In the process of testing, we found that paper will break a lot of mod compatibility, need to make a lot of adjustments, for the security of your server data, we will gradually merge the code of paper, instead of adding all at once.
