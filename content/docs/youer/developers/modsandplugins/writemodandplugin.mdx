## Environment Introduction

Youer aims to support NeoForge mods and Bukkit/Spigot/Paper plugins.

### How to Write Plugins for Youer?

Since Youer is based on NeoForge and implements the Paper API, you can write completely according to the [official Paper documentation](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/) without additional steps.

If you don't need the Paper API or want to consider compatibility with vanilla Spigot servers, you can write according to the [official Spigot documentation](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-plugin-development/).

    <span>Please remember that Youer is still under development and has not fully implemented Paper yet, which means some Paper APIs may not work properly or be inaccessible.</span>

### Youer API

Youer provides some convenient APIs for you to use. Youer inherits Mohist's API, but due to the large version gap, it needs to be redesigned. Please wait for future introductions!
