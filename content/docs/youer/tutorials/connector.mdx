### -> Using Connector in Youer:
Install the [fixed version](https://github.com/MohistMC/Connector/releases) of the mod.

The principle is that Connector modifies the `BRIGADIER_MODULE` location during startup, but Paper has already heavily modified brigadier, causing it to not be recognized correctly!

#### Connector may affect plugin communication, causing certain menu cross-server functions and cross-server PlaceholderAPI variables to not display properly. This is a known issue, please do not repeatedly report or guess the cause of the problem.
