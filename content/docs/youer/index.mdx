### FAQ
Why are updates only released weekly, and why use beta tester test versions?
 * Because development requires resources, and we maintain multiple framework server software simultaneously, we can only adopt this strategy.

Why hasn't the issue I reported been addressed?
 * Because we don't have enough time to handle all issues, we can only choose to address high-priority issues. There are also technical difficulty issues, so we cannot guarantee that all problems can be solved.

Will Youer produce more versions?
 * Currently only the 1.21.1 version is provided, and subsequent versions are not currently being considered. Unless you're willing to wait for 1.22.1.
