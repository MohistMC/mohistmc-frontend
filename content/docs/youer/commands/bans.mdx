The default function is disabled and needs to be enabled manually

bans:
  recipe: false
  item: false
  entity:
    enable: false
    vanilla_entity:
      enable: false
      whitelist: []
  enchantment: false
```


#### Basic Usage:
`/bans [add|show|setmessage] [item|item-moshou|entity|enchantment|recipe]`
This feature is preemptively disabled. Once disabled, all subsequent judgments are rejected, and neither NeoForge events nor Bukkit events can be triggered

#### Additional Usage:
`vanilla_entity` When this option is enabled, it will disable all vanilla entities without discrimination
You can add a whitelist yourself (by default excludes dropped items|armor stands|plugin NPCs)

### ❓ FAQ
- **Q:** Why can items still be used after banning?
- **A:** Some items' processing logic resides on the client side, which the server cannot intervene with, such as right-clicking a block or item to open a GUI.
