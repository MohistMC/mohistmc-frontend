### Download

To create a Mohist server, you must download from the [official download](https://mohistmc.com/download/mohist)

### Create Folder

Create a folder with the server name of your choice.
After creating the new folder, move the downloaded Mohist file into this new folder.

`If you already have a Spigot / Forge server and want to switch to Mohist, it's better to create a new server and then add your worlds, mods, and plugins.`

### Run the Server

Almost done! To run your server, do not double-click the **jar** file! You must create a file named `start.bat` where you can place your Mohist jar file.

Write the following content to the `start.bat` file:
    ```bash
    java -jar -Xmx4G downloaded-jar-file.jar
    pause
    ```
Replace `downloaded-jar-file.jar` with the actual filename of the jar file you dragged into the server folder.

Make sure the server filename in `start.bat` ends with `jar`

When finished, double-click `start.bat`
