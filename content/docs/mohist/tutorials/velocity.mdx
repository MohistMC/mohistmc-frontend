## Velocity Support (1.20.1)

### How to use Velocity with Mohist?

- If using client Mods, GeyserMC cannot be used with Mohist because Minecraft Windows 10 Edition cannot use forge and mods.

-> **mohist-config/mohist.yml**

```yaml
velocity:
  enabled: true
```

-> **server.properties**

```properties
online-mode=false
```

- Now, create a new folder for your Velocity proxy and start it with the following java command:

```bash
java -jar <velocity jar name>.jar
```

- Then after the proxy is fully started, type "**end**" to shut down your proxy.
- Now, you need to change **velocity.toml** in the Velocity folder:

-> **velocity.toml**

```toml
player-info-forwarding-mode = "modern"
```

It is recommended to read the official velocity documentation:ï¼š https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/player-information-forwarding#configuring-modern-forwarding-for-paper

- Install the velocity plugin [Ambassador](https://modrinth.com/plugin/ambassador)
- Now you can start your proxy and all Mohist servers!
