## Bungeecord Support

### How to use Bungeecord with Mohist?

⚠️ **Disclaimer: You need to use Lightfall for 1.13+ forge servers, but please note that Lightfall is still in `testing` phase and may not work with every Mod.**

Mohist recommended proxy software:

- [Waterfall](https://papermc.io/downloads#Waterfall) (for Mohist 1.12.2)
- [Lightfall](https://github.com/ArclightPowered/lightfall) (for Mohist 1.16.5+)

* If the client uses the `GeyserMC` mod, it will not work with Mohist, because Minecraft Windows 10 Edition cannot use forge mods.

How to use **Waterfall** and **Lightfall**:

- In your Mohist server folder, after you have run it at least once, modify these configurations:

-> **spigot.yml**

```yaml
bungeecord: true
```

-> **server.properties**

```properties
online-mode=false //If you still want a premium-only server, you can set it later in the Waterfall configuration file
```

- Now, create a new folder for your Waterfall proxy and start it with the following java command:

```bash
java -jar <waterfall jar name>.jar
```

- Then after the proxy is fully started, type "**end**" to shut down your proxy.
- Now, you need to change **config.yml** inside the Waterfall folder:

-> **config.yml**

```yml
query_port: 25565 //If you are not local, keep your hosting service's port
ip_forward: true
online_mode: true //or false if you want to enable cracked clients
forge_support: true
```

```yml
servers:
  lobby:
    motd: '&1My Mohist server - Lobby'
    address: localhost:25566 //use the port of your "lobby" server
    restricted: false
```

⚠️ **For 1.16.5+ users:** Players need to download [Lightfall-client](https://github.com/ArclightPowered/lightfall-client/releases) to join if your server requires client Mods. You can also see the [source code](https://github.com/ArclightPowered/lightfall-client) of the Lightfall client.

- Now you can start your proxy and all Mohist servers!
