## How to have multiple worlds with Mohist?

⚠️ **Disclaimer: To have multiple worlds in Mohist, you cannot use Multiverse or other plugin alternatives because they don't work well with forge and mods.

### -> Steps to create new worlds in 1.12.2:

- Download [this mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-enough-dimensions) and put it in your "mods" folder.

- Start the server and stop the server after it's fully loaded to generate the configuration files.

- To create a new simple world, you can use [this preset (dimensions.json)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/815331146303799296/825439539438157904/dimensions.json), download it and place it in "config/justenoughdimensions", then use /tpj 2 to teleport to this world. To create other worlds, use the same syntax as the preset and change the dimension ID (you cannot use the same dimension ID for multiple dimensions).

<details>
    <summary>Main options</summary>

    - "dim": Should be the same as the dimension ID.

    - "load_on_start": set it to true if you want your dimension to be loaded at the start of your server (should be always enabled to not cause issues with plugins).

    - "keeploaded": set it to false if you want your dimension to be unloaded if there are no players inside.

    - "id": This is the dimension ID (Remember that you can't have the same dimension ID for more than one dimension).

    - "name": The name of the dimension (only used by forge mods.)

    - "worldprovider": Type of the dimension ("WorldProviderSurface" for an overworld type world, WorldProviderHell for a nether type world and WorldProviderEnd for an end type world. you can also use worldproviders from mods if you know them!)

    - "require_exact_match": should be always present and set to true.

    There are other settings that you can set, you can see them on the mod's CurseForge page.
