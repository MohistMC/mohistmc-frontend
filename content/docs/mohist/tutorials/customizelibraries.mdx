## Custom Libraries:

> Note: Libraries are primarily loaded by Class-Path

### Examples of using custom libraries:

#### Default Libraries:

For example, Mohist has `\libraries\org\ow2\asm\asm-debug-all\5.2\asm-debug-all-5.2.jar` by default.
What if we need to update this library to 7.0?

- First, obtain `asm-debug-all-7.0.jar`
- Rename the file to `asm-debug-all-5.2.jar` (because we need to keep consistent with Class-Path)
- Replace the old jar
- Modify the configuration in mohist.yml
  - Find the default `libraries_black_list: aaaaa;bbbbbb`
  - Add `asm-debug-all-5.2` to the list: `libraries_black_list: asm-debug-all-5.2;bbbbbb`
- You have completed all steps, you can run mohist

#### Custom Libraries:

Add other jars as libraries

- Put your jar files into `\libraries\customize_libraries`
- You have completed all steps, you can run mohist
