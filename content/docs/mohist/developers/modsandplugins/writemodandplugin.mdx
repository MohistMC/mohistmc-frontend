#### Writing Mods and Plugins for Mohist

Mohist aims to support Forge mods and Bukkit/Spigot plugins.
Although it implements some Paper patches, Mohist 1.12.2 is the only version that can properly run Paper plugins.
Other versions are still under development and have not fully implemented Paper, which means any Paper plugins cannot work properly.

#### How to write Mods and Plugins for Mohist?

Since Mohist is based on Forge and implements the Bukkit/Paper API, you can write Mods and Plugins for Mohist just as you would for Forge and Bukkit/Spigot, without any additional steps.
